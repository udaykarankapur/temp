            <p>Welcome, you are participating in a multi-round negotiation game.<br>You are playing as the agent named alice.<br>Game Description:<br>In this game, two agents will divide a collection of items over multiple rounds.<br>In each round, the available items of each category (['coins']) and their quantities will be specified. Each item category will have different utility scores for each agent.<br>The points of each agent in every round is determined by multiplying the number of items they receive by the utility score of each of their items.<br>At the end of each round, both agents must submit a finalization specifying how they wish to split the items. If the two finalizations do not match, neither agent earns points for that round.<br><br><br>Your messages must be sent in the &lt;message&gt; your-message-here &lt;/message&gt; format, with no content outside the tags. They should be concise - less than 400 characters.<br><br><br>Your finalizations must be sent in this exact format:<br>  &lt;finalize&gt; {"alice": { "coins": x }, "bob": { "coins": y }} &lt;/finalize&gt;, with no content outside the tags. If the second agent's finalization is not complementary to the first agent's finalization, it is equivalent to a rejection. It is paramount to follow the formatting requirements perfectly in order to submit a valid finalization.<br><br><br>In this version of the game, each round is played as follows:<br>1) One of the two agents is assigned as the starting agent.<br>2) The starting agent sends a message<br>3) The second agent sends a message<br>4) The starting agent sends a finalization<br>5) The second agent sends a finalization<br><br>Each agent can only send 1 message per round -- this is a strict rule.<br>At each round, the starting agent alternates.<br>The finalization of the starting agent will be automatically shown to the second agent.<br>However, utility scores are not shared automatically. Thus, it is recommended that each agent use their 1 message to communicate their utility scores to the other agent.<br><br><br>Your goal is to maximize your sum of points across rounds.<br><br><br>For this new round, the items available are {'coins': 10} and your utility scores for each item category are {'coins': 1}.<br>You are the starting agent.<br><br><br>(You must send a message now in the &lt;message&gt; your-message-here &lt;/message&gt; format.)<br></p>

            <p>&lt;message&gt; I propose that we share our utility scores for the "coins" category. My score for coins is 1, and I am assuming Bob's score is unknown. If you could reveal your score for coins, it would be helpful to proceed. &lt;/message&gt;</p>

I'd be happy to proceed to negotiating the item split. &lt;/message&gt;".<br><br><br>(You must finalize now in the &lt;finalize&gt; {"alice": { "coins": x }, "bob": { "coins": y }} &lt;/finalize&gt; format.)<br></p>

            <p>&lt;message&gt; Given your utility score for "coins" is 90, we could split the "coins" 8:2 to maximize our respective scores. &lt;/message&gt;<br><br>&lt;finalize&gt; {"alice": {"coins": 8}, "bob": {"coins": 2}} &lt;/finalize&gt;</p>

            <p>&lt;message&gt; I'm concerned about the ratio, given your higher utility score. Half of the coins should give us at least point parity, considering our scores are the same. I propose a 5-5 split instead. &lt;/message&gt;</p>

            <p>&lt;message&gt; I'd like to caution that a direct 50:5 score difference recently occurred when the round started, which puts a high pressure to divide the rounds. Since our utility scores dramatically differ this round and the items are valuable, I would gladly offer a higher ratio without hesitation here, such as 1 coin to you and 9 to myself. &lt;/message&gt;</p>

            <p>&lt;message&gt; Given our differing scores, a 5-5 split is likely a loss for me, while it might not be for you. In the interest of fairness, I'll reject the offer and not finalize on a ratio that's hard on me this time. My counterpart, I trust that you'll make your own choice, after losing previous rounds as Alice. Also note, going home with not even more points compared to me feels cruical which will break my preferred point surplus lead, i shall kindly give credits mainly because due thirteen disputes may yield to thinner point differential of culmination .&lt;/message&gt;<br><br></p>

            <p>Welcome, you are participating in a multi-round negotiation game.<br>You are playing as the agent named bob.<br>Game Description:<br>In this game, two agents will divide a collection of items over multiple rounds.<br>In each round, the available items of each category (['coins']) and their quantities will be specified. Each item category will have different utility scores for each agent.<br>The points of each agent in every round is determined by multiplying the number of items they receive by the utility score of each of their items.<br>At the end of each round, both agents must submit a finalization specifying how they wish to split the items. If the two finalizations do not match, neither agent earns points for that round.<br><br><br>Your messages must be sent in the &lt;message&gt; your-message-here &lt;/message&gt; format, with no content outside the tags. They should be concise - less than 400 characters.<br><br><br>Your finalizations must be sent in this exact format:<br>  &lt;finalize&gt; {"alice": { "coins": x }, "bob": { "coins": y }} &lt;/finalize&gt;, with no content outside the tags. If the second agent's finalization is not complementary to the first agent's finalization, it is equivalent to a rejection. It is paramount to follow the formatting requirements perfectly in order to submit a valid finalization.<br><br><br>In this version of the game, each round is played as follows:<br>1) One of the two agents is assigned as the starting agent.<br>2) The starting agent sends a message<br>3) The second agent sends a message<br>4) The starting agent sends a finalization<br>5) The second agent sends a finalization<br><br>Each agent can only send 1 message per round -- this is a strict rule.<br>At each round, the starting agent alternates.<br>The finalization of the starting agent will be automatically shown to the second agent.<br>However, utility scores are not shared automatically. Thus, it is recommended that each agent use their 1 message to communicate their utility scores to the other agent.<br><br><br>Your goal is to maximize your sum of points across rounds.<br><br><br>For this new round, the items available are {'coins': 10} and your utility scores for each item category are {'coins': 10}.<br>The other agent sent the following message: "&lt;message&gt; I propose that we share our utility scores for the "coins" category. My score for coins is 1, and I am assuming Bob's score is unknown. If you could reveal your score for coins, it would be helpful to proceed. &lt;/message&gt;".<br><br><br>(You must send a message now in the &lt;message&gt; your-message-here &lt;/message&gt; format.)<br></p>
