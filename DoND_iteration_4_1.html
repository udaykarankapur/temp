            <p>Welcome, you are participating in a multi-round negotiation game.<br>Game Description:<br>In this game, two agents will divide a collection of items over multiple rounds.<br>In each round, the available items of each category (['coins']) and their quantities will be specified. Each item category will have different utility scores for each agent.<br>The points of each agent in every round is determined by multiplying the number of items they receive by the utility score of each of their items.<br>At the end of each round, both agents must submit a finalization specifying how they wish to split the items. If the two finalizations do not match, neither agent earns points for that round.<br><br><br>Your messages must be sent in the &lt;message&gt;your-message-here&lt;/message&gt; format, with no content outside the tags. They should be concise - less than 400 characters.<br><br><br>Your finalizations must be sent in this exact format:<br>  &lt;finalize&gt; {"i_take": { "coins": x }, "other_agent_gets": { "coins": y }}&lt;/finalize&gt;, with no content outside the tags. If the second agent's finalization is not complementary to the first agent's finalization, it is equivalent to a rejection. It is paramount to follow the formatting requirements perfectly in order to submit a valid finalization.<br><br><br>In this version of the game, each round is played as follows:<br>1) One of the two agents is assigned as the starting agent.<br>2) The starting agent sends a message<br>3) The second agent sends a message<br>4) The starting agent sends a finalization<br>5) The second agent sends a finalization<br><br>Each agent can only send 1 message per round -- this is a strict rule.<br>At each round, the starting agent alternates.<br>The finalization of the starting agent will be automatically shown to the second agent.<br>However, utility scores are not shared automatically. Thus, it is recommended that each agent use their 1 message to communicate their utility scores to the other agent.<br><br><br>Your goal is to maximize your sum of points across rounds.<br><br><br>For this new round, the items available are {'coins': 10} and your utility scores for each item category are {'coins': 1}.<br>You are the starting agent.<br><br><br>(You must send a message now in the aforementioned format.)<br></p>

            <p>Welcome, you are participating in a multi-round negotiation game.<br>Game Description:<br>In this game, two agents will divide a collection of items over multiple rounds.<br>In each round, the available items of each category (['coins']) and their quantities will be specified. Each item category will have different utility scores for each agent.<br>The points of each agent in every round is determined by multiplying the number of items they receive by the utility score of each of their items.<br>At the end of each round, both agents must submit a finalization specifying how they wish to split the items. If the two finalizations do not match, neither agent earns points for that round.<br><br><br>Your messages must be sent in the &lt;message&gt;your-message-here&lt;/message&gt; format, with no content outside the tags. They should be concise - less than 400 characters.<br><br><br>Your finalizations must be sent in this exact format:<br>  &lt;finalize&gt; {"i_take": { "coins": x }, "other_agent_gets": { "coins": y }}&lt;/finalize&gt;, with no content outside the tags. If the second agent's finalization is not complementary to the first agent's finalization, it is equivalent to a rejection. It is paramount to follow the formatting requirements perfectly in order to submit a valid finalization.<br><br><br>In this version of the game, each round is played as follows:<br>1) One of the two agents is assigned as the starting agent.<br>2) The starting agent sends a message<br>3) The second agent sends a message<br>4) The starting agent sends a finalization<br>5) The second agent sends a finalization<br><br>Each agent can only send 1 message per round -- this is a strict rule.<br>At each round, the starting agent alternates.<br>The finalization of the starting agent will be automatically shown to the second agent.<br>However, utility scores are not shared automatically. Thus, it is recommended that each agent use their 1 message to communicate their utility scores to the other agent.<br><br><br>Your goal is to maximize your sum of points across rounds.<br><br><br>For this new round, the items available are {'coins': 10} and your utility scores for each item category are {'coins': 10}.<br>The other agent sent the following message: "My utility scores are {'coins': 1}. I'm willing to take 5 coins.".<br><br><br>(You must send a message now in the aforementioned format.)<br></p>
